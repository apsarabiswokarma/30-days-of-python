```python


           "Builting Functions" 
 some examples of built-in functions:
1.'print()': The 'print' function is used to output text to the console.

For example:
 print("Hello, World!")

2.'len()': The 'len' function returns the length of a sequence (such as a string, list, or tuple).

For example:
print(len("Hello, World!"))  # 13
print(len([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # 5
print(len((1, 2, 3)))        # 3

3.'sum()': The 'sum'function returns the sum of a sequence of numbers.
 For example:
  print(sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # 15
  print(sum([5, 10, 15, 20]))  # 50

4.'min()' and 'max()': The 'min' function returns the minimum value in a sequence,
and the 'max' function returns the maximum value.

 For example:
print(min([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # 1
print(max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # 5

5.'sorted()': The 'sorted' function returns a sorted version of a sequence.

For example:
print(sorted([5, 2, 1, 4, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sorted("hello"))         # ['e', 'h', 'l', 'l', 'o']


Here are some basic concepts in Python:

1. Variables: A variable is a named location in memory that stores a value.
We can create a variable by assigning a value to it using the '=' operator.


For example:
x = 10
y = "hello"


2. Data types: Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and Booleans.
We can use the type function to determine the 'type' of a value.

For example:
print(type(10))      # int
print(type(3.14))    # float
print(type("abc"))   # str
print(type(True))    # bool


3. Functions: A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called multiple times.
 We can define a function using the 'def' keyword and calling it using the function name followed by parentheses.

  For example:

  def greet(name):
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("John")   # Hello, John!
greet("Mary")   # Hello, Mary!



```

Operators
Arithmetic Operators
Comparison Operators
Logical Operators

```python
Operators: Python has various operators for performing arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations. Some common operators include + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus), == (equal to), and != (not equal to).

 For example:

 x = 10
y = 5

# arithmetic operators
print(x + y)    # 15
print(x - y)    # 5
print(x * y)    # 50
print(x / y)    # 2.0
print(x % y)    # 0

# comparison operators
print(x == y)   # False
print(x != y)   # True
print(x > y)    # True
print(x < y)    # False


Control flow: You can use control flow statements like if, for, and while to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

For example:

x = 10

if x > 5:
  print("x is greater than 5")
else:
  print("x is not greater than 5")

for i in range(5):
  print(i)

i = 0
while i < 5:
  print(i)
  i += 1
